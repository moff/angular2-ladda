# Contributing

## Lint

Run `npm run lint` and fix any issues before committing changes.

## Build Ladda

Run `npm run build-ladda` to build the angular2-ladda library. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Note: Ladda must be built before building the default test app project.

## Development server

Run `npm run watch` to watch for changes to the Ladda library.
Then run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The site will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build test app

Run `npm run dev` for development, or `npm run build` for a production build.

## Publishing

After building Ladda, run `npm publish` from the dist/ladda folder (NOT from projects/ladda).
